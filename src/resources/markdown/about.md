## Bio-Inspired

Honeycombs are an example of Voronoi tessellations, in which the centers are in a consistent pattern with a set distance between each point. The honeycomb structure is a series of connected hexagons with no wasted room as all the edges are shared between bordering hexagons to optimize storage space. Not only do bees use the honeycomb structure but wasp hives, dragonfly eyes, and even bubbles when laid down close to each other all use this shape in nature.

## Design

Having a honeycomb structure with elastically compressible material, our shoe provides athletes/runners a comfortable, cushioning effect against ground contact allowing athletes to walk or run for longer periods of time compared to other shoes.

In the design of a shoe, we limited the hexagonal structure to the sole, midsole, outsole, and feather edge. By limiting the honeycomb insert to this region, we increased the ability of our shoe to protect runners against overpronation or oversupination.

Through the use of the honeycomb body as a localized insert, the stability and energy return benefits associated with the use of a honeycomb structure can be combined with the use of sole layers of elastomeric materials possessing high durability and weight reduction characteristics.
