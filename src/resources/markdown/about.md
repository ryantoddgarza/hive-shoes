## Bio-Inspired

By having a honeycomb insert (structure) with elastically compressible material our shoe provides athletes/runners a comfortable, cushioning effect against ground contact allowing athletes to walk or run for longer periods of time compared to other shoes.

In the design of a shoe, we limited the honeycomb insert/structure to the sole, midsole, outsole and feather edge. By limiting the honeycomb insert to this region we added the ability to protect our runners against overpronation or oversupponation.

Through the use of the honeycomb body as a localized insert, the stability and energy return benefits associated with the use of a honeycomb structure can be combined with the use of sole layers of elastomeric materials possessing high durability and weight reduction characteristics.
